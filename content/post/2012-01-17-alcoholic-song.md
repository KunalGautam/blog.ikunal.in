Recently I was listening to this awesome song "Sugar Rush" By A-Teens. And while thinking on it found that this song can be funnily dedicated to all alcoholic drinks ðŸ˜›. Here is lyrics for the song :

> I get a high whenever you're around  
> Sweeping from head to my toes  
> I, I gotta get my feet back on the ground
>
> 'Cause you make me go  
> Out of my way (out of my way)  
> Crossing the line (crossing the line)  
> Making me say what I have in mind
>
> You make me so excited  
> And I don't wanna fight it  
> I start to blush  
> You are my sugar rush  
> Ain't nothing better, baby  
> Is it for real or maybe?  
> You are my sugar rush  
> I start to blush  
> I got a sweet tooth  
> And a taste for you  
> And it might be too obvious but  
> I (I) I can't help myself from what I do
>
> 'Cause you make me go  
> Out of my way (out of my way)  
> Crossing the line (crossing the line)  
> Making me say what I have in mind
>
> (You make) you make me so excited  
> And I don't wanna fight it  
> I start to blush  
> You are my sugar rush  
> Ain't nothing better, baby  
> Is it for real or maybe?  
> (You are) IÂ´m loosing touch  
> You are my sugar rush
>
> Baby you're my sugar rush  
> I get weak and talk too much  
> You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted  
> Baby you're my sugar rush  
> I get weak and talk too much
>
> 'Cause you make me go  
> Out of my way (out of my way)  
> Crossing the line (crossing the line)  
> Making me say what I have in mind
>
> (You make) you make me so excited  
> (I don't) and I don't wanna fight it  
> (You are) I start to blush  
> You are my sugar rush  
> (It ain't) ain't nothing better, baby  
> (For real) is it for real or maybe?  
> (You are) IÂ´m loosing touch  
> You are my sugar rush
>
> (You make) baby you're my sugar rush  
> (I don't) I get weak and talk too much  
> (You are) you're the sweetest thing I ever tasted  
> (It ain't) baby you're my sugar rush  
> (For real) I get weak and talk too much  
> (You are)  
> You are my sugar rush
