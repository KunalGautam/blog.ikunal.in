> An elderly man in Mumbai calls his son in New York and says,
>
> ‘I hate to ruin your day son, but I have to tell you that your mother and I are getting a divorce; 35 years of marriage… and that much misery is enough!’
>
> ‘Dad, what are you talking about?’ the son screams.
>
> ‘We can’t stand the sight of each other any longer,’ the old man says.
>
> ‘We’re sick of each other, and I’m sick of talking about this, so you call your sister in Hong Kong and tell her!’
>
> Frantic, the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone.
>
> ‘Like heck they’re getting divorced,’ she shouts, ‘I’ll take care of this.’
>
> She calls Mumbai immediately, and screams at the old man, ‘You are not getting divorced. Don’t do a single thing until I get there. I’m calling my brother back, and we’ll both be there tomorrow. Until then , don’t do a thing, DO YOU HEAR??’ and she hangs up. The old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife. ’Okay’, he says, ‘It’s all set. They’re both coming for Diwali and paying their own airfare!!’
