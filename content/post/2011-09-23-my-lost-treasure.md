Yesterday, Thu Sep 22 2011, while I was tweeting and browsing the Internet, one of my friend, Deepak Agarwal ( at the time of writing this post his id is @dpk_ag) posted image of this poem. This poem is written by Miss Sidra Siddique, a class 9 student, dedicating to her heavenly aboded father. My condolence with the poor girl. May his father rests in peace!

### My Lost Treasure

    Laid in bare emptiness,
    I'm clouded with sheer helplessness,
    I saw him lying dead, here,
    After the wink of an eye he's no more here,
    The person from whom I'd learn to walk,
    loosing him forever is a profound shock.
    I miss those fights over the remote,
    and of Pa, reading the poems I wrote.
    I miss that papered princess I was,
    I miss that cornetto with my pocket money that I got,
    Pa,
    I don't want my share of teddies,
    I don't want my share of lillies,
    I don't want any one to buy me stilettos,
    I don't want any one to buy me cornettos.....
    Because all I want is,
    Not joy, neither success, nor pleasure
    But all I want is my Pa, My lost treasure .......

-Sidra Siddique
