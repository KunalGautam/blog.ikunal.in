A boy and a girl were in love. When the girl’s father came to know about their love, he did not like it at all, and so began to protest about it. Now it happened that the two lovers decided to leave their homes for a happy future.

The girl’s father started searching for the two lovers but could not find them . At last, he accepted their love and asked them to come back home thru a local newspaper… Her father said “If you both come back I will allow you to marry the guy you love, I accept that you loved each other truly.” So in this way, their love won and they returned home.

The couple next day went to town to shop for the wedding dress. He was dressed in a white shirt that day. While he was crossing the road to the other side to get some drinks for his wife, a car came and hit him and he died on the spot… The girl was devastated and lost her senses. It was only after sometime that she recovered from her shock..

The funeral and cremation was the very next day because he had died horribly. Two nights later, the girl’s mother had a dream in which she saw an old lady. The old lady asked her mother to wash the blood stains of the guy from her daughter’s dress as soon as possible.. But her mother ignored the dream. The next night her father had the same dream , he also ignored it. Then the girl had the same dream the next night, she woke up in fear and told her mother about the dream. Her mother asked her to wash the clothes with the blood stains immediately. She washed the stains but some remained. Next night she again had the same dream. She again washed the stains but some still remained. But again the next night she had the same dream and this time the old lady gave her a last warning to wash the blood stain, or else something terrible would happen.

This time the girl tried her best to wash the stains, and the clothes nearly tore, but some stains still remained.. She was very tired. In the late evening the same day while she was alone at home, someone knocked on the door. When she opened the door she saw the same old lady of her dream standing at her door. She got very scared and fainted.

The old lady woke her up…. and gave her a blue object, which shocked the girl. She asked “What is this…?” The old lady replied
