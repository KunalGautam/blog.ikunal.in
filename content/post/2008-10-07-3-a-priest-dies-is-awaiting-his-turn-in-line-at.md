Ahead of him is a guy, nattily dressed, in dark sun glasses, a loud
shirt, leather jacket & jeans.

God asks him: Please tell me who are you, so that I may know whether
to admit you into the kingdom of Heaven or not?

The guy replies: I am Pandi, Auto driver from Chennai !

God consults his ledger, smiles & says to Pandi: Please take this
silken robe & gold scarf & enter the Kingdom of Heaven ..

Now it is the priest’s turn. He stands erect and speaks out in a
booming voice: I am Pope’s Assistant so & so, Head Priest of the so &
so Church for the last 40 years.

God consults his ledger & says to the Priest: Please take this cotton
robe & enter the Kingdom of Heaven …

‘Just a minute,’ says the agonized Priest. ‘How is it that a foul
mouthed, rash driving Auto Driver is given a Silken robe & a Golden
scarf and me, a Priest, who’s spent his whole life preaching your Name
& goodness has to make do with a Cotton robe?’

‘Results my friend, results,’ shrugs God.

‘While you preached, people SLEPT; but when he drove his Auto, people
PRAYED
