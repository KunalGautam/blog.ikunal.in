> perplexed.
>
> Musharaf is bent over holding his face, which is red from  
> an apparent slap. All of them remain diplomatic and  
> nobody says anything.
>
> Sonia is thinking:  
> These Pakistani are all crazy after Aishwarya. Musharaf  
> must have tried to kiss her in the tunnel. Very proper  
> that she slapped him.
>
> Aishwarya is thinking:  
> Musharaf must have tried to kiss me but kissed Sonia  
> instead and got slapped.

> Musharaf is thinking:  
> Damn it. Manmohan must have tried to kiss Aishwarya.  
> She might have thought it was me and slapped me.

> Manmohan is thinking:  
> if this train goes through another tunnel I will make
