Now days children really think ahead of their Time. I just now received call of a child \[ will make it anonymous \] to be attend his school call and talk like his parents 😞. It make me feel tooo sad . Is this our education system which only make fear in heart of children or should i blame parents \[ sorry anonymous kid if u feel hurted \] that they cannot share with their parents.

In my case i feel proud that I've got really nice parent. I told my parent my marks as i got them. Doesn't matter if it was less or what they never scolded me for it 😃. and regarding parents meeting i always say to them agar timepaas karna ho to jaayiyega .

Dear Anonymous Kid I really feeling bad for you.You are asking me to do really a wrong thing 😐
