In the village, there were few young mind who were suspicious of his visionary wisdom, made a plan to prove wise old man wrong. Their plan was pretty simple. Their plan was to keep a alive butterfly in their fist and ask wise old man if the butterfly is alive or dead. The planned to kill the butterfly by crushing in their fist if old man says the butterfly is alive, or to leave the butterfly flying, if he says that butterfly is dead.
