It's going to be long time that I've written nothing on my blog. Recently my friend [Anurag Upadhaya](http://eanurag.com) had his first flight experience. Hence I thought I should also share my first flight experience.

In India, it is very hard to get a confirmed ticket on train towards Bihar/U.P. route during summer vacation. Recently I had to attend marriage ceremony of my Brother-in-law from Samastipur, Bihar. Since I was unable to get confirmed ticket, I booked flight ticket from Pune to Patna (via Delhi).

With no previous experience of Flight journey, I was little bit scared and don't know any procedure. So I decided to leave early from home to understand things.

I left my home at 3 A.M. IST on 17th of May 2015 and reached airport in 15 minutes. After bidding ADIEU to papa, I entered into Pune International Airport premises. There I seen signs stating Jet Airways entry from Gate No. 1. So I entered through gate 1. I sat inside Airport, and tried to understand procedure. at 3:30 people started queuing up near Jet Airways counter. So I followed people in queue. With basic security check I reached at counter, where Jet employee asked my seat preference. Without any second thought I said window seat and voilla! she gave me tickets from Pune to Delhi (9W364) and Delhi to Patna (9W 730). They took normal luggage and tagged it. I was told I will get luggage in Patna.

Before leaving counter, I observed that people were taking tags for their cabin luggage, I asked for it and she replied it is for cabin luggage. So I took one and attached to my Laptop bag. After getting in further, another security check was to be done. Here we need to deposit our mobile and laptop separately. After checking in they stamped on tag. And we were inside.

As It was only 4:10 A.M. I sat on chairs at ground floor to notice what to do further. While I was watching signs which were warning that Photography is prohibited, I seen a sign that departure is from 1st floor. So I followed people who were going on 1st floor. There it was a big area with many gates. I sat there waiting for boarding call. As there was no mention of boarding gate, I asked staff there from which gate I can board for Delhi Jet Airways. Her reply was though it will be gate number 5 but it will be announced later.

Waiting there till 5:30 A.M. I came to know flight is delayed as it was not yet arrived. Few passengers were getting anxious as they had their connecting flight from IGI Delhi. I was quiet as I had ample amount of time for my connecting flight. Around 5:40 A.M they made boarding call, and I was inside aircraft. This was the first time I seen the Jet Bridge/Aerobridge. I was expecting we need to walk near aircraft and go up by stairs ðŸ˜›

Every passenger was welcomed by Air Hostess. I said Namaste and with extra smile Air Hostess also said Namaste ðŸ˜‰. After all setteled down, all passengers were demonstrated with essential flight safety guide. Though they didn't mentioned about life jacket ðŸ˜›.I made call to mom that I'll be switching off mobile as plane is going to take off. At 6:15 A.M flight was on runway and we were told to turn off our electronic devices. Within few minutes aircraft took off . All I can say I got blank for few moment due to sudden inertia. After gaining some consciousness, I Seen below window and seen a clean road from Pune outskirts with really small car plying.

Windows watching didn't gone for long as there was bright light of sun coming through windows. After that First Pilot announced we can use our electronic devices in AirPlane mode. So I started playing Angry Bird. In moment of 15 minutes Breakfast was there. It was tasty. Breakfast consists of Idli, upma, Sambhar, Bread Bun and fruits.

While breakfast was over. We were told by First pilot that flight got delayed but will try to reach at IGI at 8 AM. He also told flight is going through Mumbai, Ahemdabad, Udaipur airspace. He also told that flight is right now at 30-32k Feets above ground. He also told that there may be several turbulence due to poor weather and we don't need to worry. While this was going on Caption made announcement to keep shades up and crew member to get back to place as we were going to land in few minutes. When we landed and aircraft was on the way to terminal we were told it is safe to turn on our electronic devices. I made call to Mom again that I've landed safely in Delhi.

After that I followed people. Though it was little bit confusing about exit or internal transfer, I asked Jet Airways staff at desk about direction I've to go for my next connecting flight. He guided me the way. Again I was in the queue for security check and we need to change the cabin baggage tag. After security clearance and few steps ahead I was inside IGI T3 Terminal. It was like a shopping mall with lots of people. I seen a display where my Flight number was mentioned with gate number. So I followed sign. Actually I missed last sign and instead of going to Jet Airways area I gone toward Air India area. after a long walk (thankfully escalator were there) I reached end. I saw a police uncle and asked where is gate number 37 He said its on other side and asked if my flight is announced. I said its on 2:30PM and he said that its okay that I have lot of time.

so I got back to Jet Airways area. I sat near gate number 37. Plugged my laptop and started browsing internet. It was really boring to have my time passed. I was thinking not to sleep as I was feeling sleepy.

Not to mention there were nice resting chair with full body support on which one can sleep easily at the Airport. Apart from Humans there were pigeons too at IGI airport. Not to mention as the area got empty it was chilly cool. View was nice as I was watching aircraft landing and taking off. From there I came to know FedEx have their own aircraft too.

![Pigeon at IGI T3](/post/112/WP_20150517_006.jpg)  
Just 1 hour before boarding time, I got SMS saying that IGI is silent airport and no announcement will be made. Hence one need to get info from screens installed at various places. When boarding time came near. I glued near screen which displays gate number. After few minutes again via Jet bridge passengers were transferred to aircraft. Again same safety instruction were demonstrated after passenger settled down. And once again they came with Life jacket but didn't demonstrated it. I made call to Mom and to my wife who was at my in-laws-home, that I'm switching off my mobile as plane is going to take off. Before that I took this picture.

After aircraft got taxiing to runway we were told to turn off our electronic devices. with a long route towards main runway aircraft was in air in matter of seconds. And here my second flight journey that too on same day started.

This time I was lucky that there was no sunshine towards my side. I captured pic of horizon. Sky was way too dark blue. In few minutes lunch was served.  
![So Tiny world below ðŸ˜ƒ](/post/112/WP_20150517_011.jpg)  
Lunch was consisted of a roll and chocolate ðŸ˜› I was like "Itne se mera kya hoga". I asked for more and Air Hostess said if there will be I'll be provided. Although I was not provided extra ðŸ˜ž While having lunch I was looking below and I can see a train was going. It was looking damn small. The view of white cloud below was mesmerizing. They were shining too bright.

Anyways while wrapping up Caption made announcement that we were going to land in few minutes. from window I seen some runway( Most probably Bihta Runway). After that while descending I saw most probably Danapur railway station. And in a matter of minutes we landed safely. Announcement was made from where we can college luggage. I turned on my phone and it was unable to latch on network. From there we have to take stairs to go down ward. I was expecting Jet bridge this time ðŸ˜›

After coming down I was welcomed with hot air. While some people were busy in taking photograph with Airplane I was in a rush to go inside Airport building. Inside building I was waiting for my luggage. Meanwhile phone was connected to network and I made call to my brother in law. Meanwhile waiting for luggage. There were three short power disruption at Jai Prakash Narayan International Airport, Patna I felt finally I was welcomed at home land Bihar ðŸ˜› After waiting for 15 minutes my luggage came. I pick it up checked tag and came outside the building where my brother in laws were waiting for me.

In short it was a nice fun trip. All I can say it was too fast I reached to Patana. I came back to my In-laws-home via Gandhi Setu, which was having huge traffic jam due to maintenance work going over it. To summarize my experience, I'm posting a view of River Ganga from Gandhi Setu.
