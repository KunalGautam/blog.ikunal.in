I wish I could say, the feelings that went away,  
I will I could tell, things I did that no one ever will..  
I wish you could hear, the voice behind my silence..  
I wish you could see those tears..  
I wish you could feel that pain burning inside me..  
You promised that we'd together..But you were never here...

I wish I could show you, your beauty in my eyes..  
I wish I could I tell you, how you made me feel inside..  
I wish you could know, those feelings that disappeared..  
I wish you wouldn't go, you left but I was there..  
I wish you could remember, fake promises that you made..  
I wish I never had to hear, those awful things that you said.

I wish you still remember, the times we had together,  
I wish you still love those things, coz nothing can ever be better..
