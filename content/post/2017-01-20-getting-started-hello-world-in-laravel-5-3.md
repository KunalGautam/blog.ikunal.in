To get started with basic page running in Laravel, we will open file called **web.php** which is inside **routes** folder (i.e. inside 'laravel_project_folder/routes/web.php'). Delete existing content in the file and add following code to get started with.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/KunalGautam/b8993c6383338950fd92b249e01d8246.js"></script>

By using the above code, whenever a [get request](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.3) for base directory is passed to the server, it will return "Hello World!" as an output. To see output we need to get back to terminal and pass the following command in the directory where the Laravel project is present.

`php artisan serve`

It will display that "Laravel development server started on http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

So open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser and you will see Hello World! page generated by Laravel ðŸ˜ƒ
