I wish I could tell you, what’s going on in my mind...

I wish I could tell you...

A thousand things I want to have.... and a thousand things I want to do...  
But as I get near to them... I feel that my reality isn’t even true.

I wish I could tell you the things going around.  
I was just looking for simple happiness. Even that I could not found...

There are voices in my head, and I listen to music to shut them down.  
But all I could listen are just noises... to calm your soul there aren’t enough sounds...

There are a million things I want to show and a million things I want to say.  
I hope that God is looking down on us... and just to get enough time, I pray...

Not sure if there are enough words or there is enough time.  
And to tell you all that...I’m just making this rhyme...

-Anurag Upadhaya
