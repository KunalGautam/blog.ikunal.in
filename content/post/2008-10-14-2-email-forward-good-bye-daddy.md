> A father put his three year old daughter to bed,
>
> Told her a story and listened to her prayers which she ended by saying
>
> “God bless Mommy, God bless daddy, God bless grandma and good-bye grandpa.”
>
> The father asked, “Why did you say good-bye grandpa?”
>
> The little girl said, “I don’t know daddy, it just seemed like the thing todo.”
>
> The next day grandpa died.
>
> The father thought it was a strange coincidence.
>
> A few months later the father put the girl to bed and
>
> listened to her prayers, which went like this:
>
> “God bless Mommy, God Bless daddy and good-bye grandma..”
>
> The next day the grandmother died.
>
> Oh my god, thought the father, this kid is in contact with the other side.
>
> Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say,
>
> “God bless Mommy and good-bye daddy.”
>
> He practically went into shock.
>
> He couldn’t sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office.
>
> He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch sent in and watched the clock.
>
> He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay.
>
> He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound.
>
> Finally midnight arrived, he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.
>
> When he got home his wife said
>
> “I’ve never seen you work so late, what’s the matter?”
>
> He said “I don’t want to talk about it, I’ve just spent the worst day of my life.”
>
> She said “You think you had a bad day, you’ll never believe what happened HERE.
>
> He asked “What”??????
>
> She said “This morning our neighbor James suddenly died.”
