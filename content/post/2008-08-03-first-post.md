Welcome to every one at K for Kunal . Dil hain chota sa Choti Si Aasha .This is the song which Iâ€™m going humming all time . Not my heart is small \[ Iâ€™m big hearted ðŸ˜‰ \] but I have small wish to run my personal blog . This idea was in my mind from last few years . Some people told me not to start so I didnâ€™t started yet but now I cannot stop myself anymore.

So here is my new blog K For Kunal , My pen My voice. First I would like to thanks all my friends for great support to make the blog up . Firstly I would like to thank [Harshad](http://www.tech-exclusive.com/ "http://www.tech-exclusive.com/") for the name and title of the blog , [Anurag](http://techunknown.com "Tech Unknown") for theme , [Aravind](http://aravindjose.com/ "http://aravindjose.com/") for Logo making , and last but not least my one and only ,lovely Kid Pandu aka [Rajesh ](http://lifeofrajesh.com "http://lifeofrajesh.com")for inaugurating the blog on special occasion of friendship day ðŸ˜ƒ .
