> As a daily habit Pintu was reading newspaper. Suddenly he asked his father, ” Dad! What does it mean by ‘Governance System’ ? ” “It’s like…” father said while thinking, “See! I earn and bring money to home, mean’s I am a ‘Money Holder’. Your mother decides where and how to spend that money and that means she is ‘Government’. That maid in our home is doing all the household works, so she will be ‘Labour Class’. You are a ‘Common man’ or ‘Public’. Your kid brother is ‘Future’ or the ‘Next Generation’, understand?”.

> That day Pintu slept with all those thoughts. In the middle of the night he woke-up because his kid brother was crying. He wetted the matrices so he was crying. Pintu went to woke-up his mother. She was in deep sleep so Pintu went to the Maiden’s room to wake her up. But there his father was sleeping with the maid. So he came back with frustration.

> Next morning father asked Pintu, ” Hey Pintu Darling! You understood the ‘Governance System’? “. Pintu replied, “Yeah Dad, I understood! When Money Holder is exploiting Labour Class, our Government is sleeping. Future of our nation is crying for not getting their basic needs fulfilled and in all this Common Man is suffering!”
