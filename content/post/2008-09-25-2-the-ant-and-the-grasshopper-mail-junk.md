> An Old Story:
>
> The Ant works hard in the withering heat all summer building its house  
> and laying up supplies for the winter.
>
> The Grasshopper thinks the Ant is a fool and laughs dances plays the  
> summer away.
>
> Come winter, the Ant is warm and well fed. The Grasshopper has no food  
> or shelter so he dies out in the cold.
>
> New Indian Version:
>
> The Ant works hard in the withering heat all summer building its house  
> and laying up supplies for the winter.
>
> The Grasshopper thinks the Antâ€™s a fool and laughs dances plays the  
> summer away.
>
> Come winter, the shivering Grasshopper calls a press conference and  
> demands to know why the Ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed  
> while others are cold and starving.
>
> NDTV, BBC, CNN show up to provide pictures of the shivering Grasshopper  
> next to a video of the Ant in his comfortable home with a table filled  
> with food.
>
> The World is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be that this  
> poor Grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?
>
> Arundhati Roy stages a demonstration in front of the Antâ€™s house.
>
> Medha Patkar goes on a fast along with other Grasshoppers demanding that  
> Grasshoppers be relocated to warmer climates during winter .
>
> Mayawati states this as `injusticeâ€™ done on Minorities.
>
> Amnesty International and Koffi Annan criticize the Indian Government  
> for not upholding the fundamental rights of the Grasshopper.
>
> The Internet is flooded with online petitions seeking support to the  
> Grasshopper (many promising Heaven and Everlasting Peace for prompt  
> support as against the wrath of God for non-compliance) .
>
> Opposition MPs stage a walkout. Left parties call for â€˜Bengal Bandhâ€™ in  
> West Bengal and Kerala demanding a Judicial Enquiry.
>
> CPM in Kerala immediately passes a law preventing Ants from working hard  
> in the heat so as to bring about equality of poverty among Ants and  
> Grasshoppers.
>
> Lalu Prasad allocates one free coach to Grasshoppers on all Indian  
> Railway Trains, aptly named as the â€˜Grasshopper Rathâ€™.
>
> Finally, the Judicial Committee drafts the â€™ Prevention of Terrorism  
> Against Grasshoppers Actâ€™ \[POTAGA\], with effect from the beginning of  
> the winter.
>
> Arjun Singh makes â€˜Special Reservation â€™ for Grasshoppers in Educational  
> Institutions in Government Services.
>
> The Ant is fined for failing to comply with POTAGA and having nothing  
> left to pay his retroactive taxes,itâ€™s home is confiscated by the  
> Government and handed over to the Grasshopper in a ceremony covered by  
> NDTV.
>

> Lalu calls it â€˜Socialistic Justice â€˜.
>
> CPM calls it the â€™ Revolutionary Resurgence of the Downtrodden â€˜

> somewhere in India ,
>
> ..AND
>
> As a result of losing lot of hard working Ants and feeding the  
> grasshoppers, India is still a developing countryâ€¦!! ! ğŸ˜ƒ ğŸ˜ƒ ğŸ˜ƒ
