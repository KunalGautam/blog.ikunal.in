> During work, Raman and Narayan were chatting: Raman: Narayan, I’ve been attending night classes for 5 months now and I have an exam next week. Narayan: oh! Raman: For example, do you know who is Graham Bell? Narayan: No Raman: He’s the inventor of the phone in 1876; if you take night Courses you would know this. The next day, the same discussion took place: Raman: Do you know who Alexander Dumas is? Narayan: No Raman: He’s the author of “The 3 Musketeers”, if you take night courses, you would know this. The next day, once again: Raman: And do you know who Jean Jacques Rousseau is? Narayan: No Raman: He’s the author of “Confessions”, if you take night courses, you would know this. This time, Narayan got irritated and said: And you, do you know who is Balakrishnan Kuppuswamy? Raman: No Narayan: He’s the guy roaming with your wife!! If you stop night courses, you would know. ” Moral : There is ‘some thing’ important in life than Work and General Knowledge 😉. “
