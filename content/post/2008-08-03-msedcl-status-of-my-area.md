MSEDCL Status in My Area

![MSEDCL](/post/2/msedcl-joke.jpg "MSEDCL")

For those who don't know what is MSEDCL let me tell its Full form its Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited . This post is regarding That funny department MSEDCL . Few days ago they decided to do load shedding in Pune area which was earlier having zero load shedding. They started from 1 hours and now it is at peak i.e at 7 hours. They stated that due to short rain fall demand has increased . BUT DEAR MSEDCL now its raining still demand high or you people will still cut throat of us ?? .

Needless to say it is 7 hours power cut but in my area more then 8hours either due to low voltage or due to fluctuations or due to loose wiring . All they know is to take bribe . Once transformer was blown up , the power was restored after 5 days . Imagine we don't have water supply too. our drinking water comes from electricity only \[ ya we have RO water purifier which run on electricity only \] , I was disconnected from friends for those black days \[ mobile was down \] . thanks to my mom mobile that it can run for so much long time \[ and I charged it thru my UPS to ðŸ˜‰ \] .

I'm still using one stabilizer for running my PC and two stabilizer at peak time \[ always in evening \] . The voltage is too low in evening time that if CFL Bulbs will lighten up its really a great achievement for us ðŸ˜ƒ . Thank god our Tube Lights have capacity to glow in 90 V also . We cannot have Inverter in this situation too .

Over all moral of this long article : Government offices are still home for bribery we need some private players in Electricity too for distribution Purpose not for power generation.
