> In a small town in India, a person decided to open up his Bar business, which was right opposite to the Temple. The Temple &amp; its congregation started a campaign to block the Bar from opening with petitions and prayed daily against his business.

> Work progressed. However, when it was almost complete and was about to open a few days later, a strong lightning struck the Bar and it was burnt to the ground.

> The temple folks were rather smug in their outlook after that, till the Bar owner sued the Temple authorities on the grounds that the Temple through its congregation &amp; prayers was ultimately responsible for the demise of his bar shop, either through direct or indirect actions or means.

> In its reply to the court, the temple vehemently denied all responsibility or any connection that their prayers were reasons to the bar shop’s demise.

> As the case made its way into court, the judge looked over the paperwork at the hearing and commented: “I don’t know how I’m going to decide this case, but it appears from the paperwork that we have a bar owner who believes in the power of prayer and an entire temple and its devotees that doesn’t.”
