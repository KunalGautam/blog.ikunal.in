Finally I've decided to leave the WordPress platform and move to static website generator. For this purpose I'm using Hugo platform, which is really great.

Exporting from WordPress was easy, just needed few checks and it was done with breeze. I've deleted few post which were having Macromedia flash content or links which were broken.

Hope for the best!
