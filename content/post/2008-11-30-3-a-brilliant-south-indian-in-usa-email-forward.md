> It was the first day of a school in USA and a new Indian student named Chandrasekhar Subramanian entered the fourth grade.  
>  The teacher said, ‘Let’s begin by reviewing some American History.  
>  Who said ‘Give me Liberty, or give me Death’?  
>  She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up:  
>  ‘Patrick Henry, 1775’ he said.  
>  ‘Very good!’  
> Who said ‘Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?’  
>  Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar.  
>  ‘Abraham Lincoln, 1863’ said Chandrasekhar.  
>  The teacher snapped at the class, ‘Class, you should be ashamed.  
>  Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about its history than you do.’
>
> She heard a loud whisper: ‘F\*\*k the Indians,’  
>  ‘Who said that?’ she demanded.  
>  Chandrasekhar put his hand up. ‘General Custer, 1862.’  
>  At that point, a student in the back said,’I’m gonna puke.’  
>  The teacher glares around and asks ‘All right! Now, who said that?’  
>  Again, Chandrasekhar says, ‘Al Gore to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.’  
>  Now furious, another student yells, ‘Oh yeah? Suck this!’  
>  Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher ,  
>  ‘Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!’  
>  Now with almost mob hysteria someone said ‘You little shit. If you say anything else, I’ll kill you.’  
>  Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice,  
>  ‘Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against him- 2004.’  
>  The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, ‘Oh sh\*t, we’re f\*\*ked!’  
>  And Chandrasekhar said quietly, I think it was George Bush, Iraq , 2007.’
