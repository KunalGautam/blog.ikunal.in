![Y U NO GOOGLE IT](/post/106/google.jpg "Y U NO GOOGLE IT")

Dear Friend,

I beg your pardon for dropping you to this page. This is to intimate you that there is nothing I can help you in this matter. Please take some pain and search the query you asked me yourself. I know its really hard for you to search even the easiest thing over the internet. But really it will be helpful to me if you can search whatever you are asking to me. It will make my life a lot easier ðŸ˜ƒ

You can search on various search engines like [google](http://google.com), [bing](http://bing.com) etc. etc. Thanks for understanding and saving my time by not asking same thing again!
