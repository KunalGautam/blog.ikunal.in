> Here is an article from a colleague.. Very interesting especially the last conversation.
>
> How often do you get a call and hear a lilting voice say, “Hi! I am Pooja calling from XYZ bank. Sir, we are offering free platinum credit card to our customers. Are you interested?” (uttered in a single breath) And you think, “Oh no, not again!” You politely (or rudely) reply, “Sorry, I am not interested.” And the conversation ends there. But imagine a reply that frustrates the caller with your witty response. I have some cool ideas for making these unsolicited calls a pleasant experience. My friends and I have applied these ideas and we have derived immense pleasure from such pranks. We have frustrated them more than the other way round.

> First caller:
>
> Girl: Hello Sir, this is Pooja calling from Country Club.  
> Me: Hi Pooja!  
> Girl: Sir, we are offering life time Country Club membership for Rs.1.5 lakh only!  
> Me: Wow, what an offer! Only 1.5 lakh! How come so cheap?  
> Girl: Sir, I am not joking (with a chuckle).  
> Me: Neither me. You know, one of my friends already has Club Mahindra membership at Rs.1.5 lakh per year. Do you have any concession on group booking? I think we have around 8 people in my team.
>
> Girl: Sir, along with this, you will get 2 air tickets to Goa absolutely free!  
> Me: Free? I mean after becoming a member, isn’t it?  
> Girl: We are also offering 8/6 site in Tumkur.  
> Me: What should I do with that site?  
> Girl: You know Sir, if you have more people in your group, you can have a farm house there …  
> Me: … where we can enjoy our retired life (continuing from where she left)  
>  Girl: I am not joking, Sir!  
> Me: Who said that you are joking? Seriously Madam, I am serious. (can’t control my loud laughter this time)  
> Girl: Ok Sir, I think you are not interested.  
> And she hangs up.
>
> Second caller:
>
> Girl: Hi Sir, this is Pooja calling from ICICI Bank.  
> Me: Oh, Pooja, nice to hear your voice!  
> Girl: (amused by reaction) Sir, we are offering home loans for 12% interest.  
> Me: Oh, is that so? It’s good, but I have an offer from another bank which is giving home loan for only 2% interest!  
> Girl: Only 2% interest?  
> Me: Yeah, it’s only 2%, seriously.  
> Girl: Which bank, Sir? I do not think any bank is offering at this interest rate.
>
> Me: (lowering my voice) I can’t tell you, you know it’s a private bank!  
> Girl: No Sir, it’s not possible. If that’s the case, then, I’m also interested.  
> Me: If you want to know the name of the bank, give your mobile number or e-mail ID as I cannot disclose this information over phone. I am bound not to disclose the details.
>
> Girl: Okay.  
> She disconnects the call.
>
> Third caller:
>
> Girl: Hello Sir, I am Pooja calling from …  
> Me: (interrupting her) Hang on for a moment … (taking my time) …Okay let’s play “Kaun Banega Crorepati” with… sorry, I forgot your name?
>
> Girl: Sorry …  
> Me: What’s your name, Madam? Am I speaking in an alien language?  
> Girl: Pooja  
> Me: Audience, we have Pooja on our hot seat. Let’s play “Kaun Banega Crorepati” with Pooja. (of course, mimicking Big B’s accent)
>
> Here is the first question to Pooja for 1,000 rupees on your computer screen. (adding standard KBC music)  
> Which bank you are calling from? a) ICICI (b) HDFC (c) Deutsche (d) Others  
> Girl: Funny (light laugh)…Okay, I am calling from HDFC.  
> Me: Computer, please lock (b) HDFC …And yes (b) HDFC is the right answer. You have won 1,000 rupees!  
> Girl: Sir, are you interested in … (again interruption by me)  
> Me: (my own voice) Aren’t you enjoying it? I think YES (switching back to Big B voice again) Ready for another question? And here goes the second question for 2,000 rupees on your computer screen. What is the reason behind your call to me?
>
> (a) Credit/debit card (b) Home loan/personal loan (c) Mutual fund (d) Others  
> Girl: Okay, it’s enough. Are you interested in free Gold Credit Card offered by us?  
> Me: Oh no, wrong answer. Sorry Poojaji, I already have credit card from ICICI. I have been telling the participants that whenever you have doubt in mind, go for the life lines. And you have not used any of your life lines. What a pity!
>
> She hangs up. (as expected)

> If you are already following my examples, then you are welcome to share your experiences and ideas. Otherwise try it once – it’s certainly worth a try.
